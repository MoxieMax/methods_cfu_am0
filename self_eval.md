# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
  # Fairly confident. If I have questions about specific ones I can look up what they do, but so far they seem easy to follow.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
  # Not super confident, but some of that is overcomplicating things in my head when I'm trying to solve them. I found that talking out what I was trying to do while I did them helped to make me focus on the issue at hand and keep it simple.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
  # They're extremely versatile and I know we're just scratching the surface, so I'm excited to see what they can do. Do you use methods for call and response (user input?) questions?
